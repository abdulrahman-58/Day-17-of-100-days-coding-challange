function multipleHobbies(...hobbies: string[]) {

// **Question 51:** Refactoring to Arrow Functions: Take a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle and refactor it into an arrow function.
function calculateArea(width: number, height: number): number{
    return width* height;

let calculateAreaArrow = (width: number, height: number):number => width* height;
console.log(`Area of Rectangle is ${calculateAreaArrow(5,8)}`);
